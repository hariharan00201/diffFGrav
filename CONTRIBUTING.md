# Contributing to FGrav Guidelines

Thank you so much for wanting to contribute to FGrav. Here are a few important things you should know about contributing:

  1. Pull requests are great for small fixes for bugs, documentation, etc.
  2. Code contributions require updating relevant documentation.
  3. New / modified features require discussion before coding.

The following guidelines apply to all contributors.

## General Guidelines
 - One commit == one logical change
 - Construct commits so that code is always in a working state
 - Do not mix style change commits (whitespace etc.) with functional code changes
 - When writing a commit message: Describe **why** a change is being made
 - Tests are the best way to document intent
 - The project already has good test coverage, so look at some of the existing tests if you're unsure how to go about it

## Making Changes
* Fork the `FGrav` repository
* Make your changes
* [Run tests](README.md#test)
* Push your changes to a branch in your fork
* Submit a pull request to the repository
* Update `FGrav` GITHUB issue with the generated pull request link
